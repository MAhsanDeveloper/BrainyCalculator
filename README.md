# 🔢 Brainy Calculator

A powerful scientific calculator built using **React** and **math.js**.  
It supports a wide range of mathematical operations including:

- Basic arithmetic ( + − × ÷ )
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan and their inverses)
- Hyperbolic functions (sinh, cosh, tanh and their inverses)
- Exponentiation and powers
- Factorials
- Pi (π)

## 🚀 Features

✅ Basic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
✅ Trigonometric and inverse functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `asin`, `acos`, `atan`  
✅ Hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic: `sinh`, `cosh`, `tanh`, `asinh`, `acosh`, `atanh`  
✅ Power and exponential: `x^y`, `e^x`  
✅ Special constants: Pi (π)  
✅ Factorial (n!)  
✅ Responsive and clean UI
